The Obsidian Better Command Palette plugin constructs a custom command palette by extending Obsidian's `SuggestModal` class and implementing a system of "adapters" for different search contexts (commands, files, tags).

Here's a breakdown of its construction:

* **Main Plugin Class (`src/main.ts`):**
    * Initializes plugin settings and creates `OrderedSet` instances to track previously used commands and tags.
    * Instantiates a `SuggestionsWorker` (a web worker) for offloading fuzzy search operations, preventing UI freezes.
    * Registers commands to open the custom palette for general commands, file search (prefixed with `/`), and tag search (prefixed with `#`).
    * The core palette is an instance of `BetterCommandPaletteModal`.

* **Better Command Palette Modal (`src/palette.ts`):**
    * Extends Obsidian's `SuggestModal<Match>`.
    * Adds a custom title element (`.better-command-palette-title`) at the top of the modal.
    * Includes a "hidden items header" (`.hidden-items-header`) to toggle visibility of hidden items.
    * Manages different "action types" (Commands, Files, Tags) using dedicated "adapter" classes (`BetterCommandPaletteCommandAdapter`, `BetterCommandPaletteFileAdapter`, `BetterCommandPaletteTagAdapter`).
    * Updates the modal's title, empty state text, and instructions based on the currently active adapter.
    * Uses a `suggestionsWorker` to perform fuzzy searching asynchronously, and updates suggestions when results are received.
    * Handles various key bindings, including closing with backspace, opening files/creating new files with modifiers (e.g., `Mod+Enter` for creating files), and switching between search types.
    * Renders suggestions by adding specific CSS classes (`mod-complex`, `hidden`) and icons (e.g., `cross` for hiding items, `filled-pin` for pinned items).
    * Allows toggling of hidden items, which are visually distinguished in the suggestion list.

* **Suggest Modal Adapter (`src/utils/suggest-modal-adapter.ts`):**
    * An abstract base class for handling item-specific logic for different palette types (commands, files, tags).
    * Provides common properties like `titleText`, `emptyStateText`, `allItems`, `pinnedItems`, `prevItems`, and `hiddenIds`.
    * Defines abstract methods `renderSuggestion` and `onChooseSuggestion` that concrete adapters must implement.
    * Manages `hiddenIds` for each adapter type, allowing users to hide specific items.
    * Sorts items by prioritizing recently used or pinned items based on user settings.

* **Specific Adapters (`src/palette-modal-adapters/*.ts`):**
    * **`CommandAdapter` (`src/palette-modal-adapters/command-adapter.ts`):**
        * Retrieves all available Obsidian commands using `app.commands.listCommands()`.
        * Identifies pinned commands from the internal command palette plugin.
        * Renders command suggestions, including displaying the plugin name (if enabled) and custom/default hotkeys.
        * Executes the chosen command using `app.commands.executeCommandById()`.
    * **`FileAdapter` (`src/palette-modal-adapters/file-adapter.ts`):**
        * Populates `allItems` with files from `app.metadataCache.getCachedFiles()` and also includes unresolved links.
        * Handles file type exclusions based on settings.
        * Renders file suggestions, optionally displaying only note names or hiding `.md` extensions based on user settings.
        * Supports opening files in new panes and creating new files based on user input and modifier keys.
    * **`TagAdapter` (`src/palette-modal-adapters/tag-adapter.ts`):**
        * Fetches all tags from `app.metadataCache.getTags()`.
        * Renders tag suggestions, showing the count of files where each tag is found.
        * Choosing a tag switches the palette to file search mode, pre-filling the query with the selected tag.

* **Styling (`src/styles.scss`):**
    * The `styles.scss` file defines the visual appearance of the custom palette. It uses standard CSS (compiled from SCSS) with Obsidian's CSS variables (`var(--text-accent)`, `var(--text-faint)`, etc.) to seamlessly integrate with the Obsidian theme.
    * Specific classes like `.better-command-palette`, `.better-command-palette-title`, `.hidden-items-header`, `.suggestion-item.hidden`, and `.suggestion-flair` are used to style various elements, ensuring a consistent look and feel with the native Obsidian UI.

* **Utilities (`src/utils/utils.ts`, `src/utils/ordered-set.ts`, `src/utils/palette-match.ts`):**
    * `generateHotKeyText`: Converts hotkey objects into displayable text, considering OS-specific modifiers (Mac vs. Windows) and a "Hyper Key" override.
    * `OrderedSet`: A custom data structure that maintains insertion order and tracks the last time an item was added, used for prioritizing recently used items.
    * `PaletteMatch`: A simple class to encapsulate the `id`, `text`, and `tags` of a suggestion item.
    * `matchTag`: Utility for matching tags, supporting nested tags.
    * `getOrCreateFile`, `openFileWithEventKeys`: Functions for file system interactions and opening files within Obsidian.
    * `createPaletteMatchesFromFilePath`: Extracts aliases and tags from file metadata to create searchable `PaletteMatch` objects.

In essence, the plugin leverages Obsidian's API (specifically `SuggestModal` and its internal `app` object for accessing commands, hotkeys, and metadata), a modular adapter pattern for different search contexts, a web worker for performance, and Obsidian's CSS variables for styling to create a custom command palette that looks and behaves very similarly to the native one, with added features.
